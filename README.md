# Corne keyboard configuration
Hi there! This is the keyboard configuration that I'm currently using on my Corne LP Wireless as software dev.
There's 4 layers:
- Default
- Symbols (raise)
- Numpad (lower)
- Config (both)
### Default
It's a default layer, without stranger things...

### Numpad (lower)

Right side a numpad, Left side the arrows.
In the first column on the left side you have two special keys:
- Middle button: when tap, switch to the next tab.
- Top button: when tap, switch to the previous tab.

Also you have the "Enter" (return) key on the "delete" button of the Default layer.

### Symbols (raise)

Here you have all of the common symbols.

#### Right side

On the top of the right side, arithmetic symbols and CAPS LOCK.
On the center/bottom of the right side, you have some text navigation keys that you can combine with the arrows.

#### Left side

On the center of the left side, the arrows (same of Numpad layer).
At the bottom of the left side, macro keys that open and close these symbols: {}, [], ().

### Config (both)

This layer is mainly to support the Numpad layer, like, when you ar writting a math and need arithmetic symbols, you just switch to this layer and have these symbols on the top of the right side.
Also you have, on the left side, the same macro keys to open and close {}, [], (), up and down volume and brightness increase and decrease

## ZMK Keymap Editor
I used the ZMK keymap editor of [@nickcoutsos](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/keymap-editor) to do my `corne.keymap` file: https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/
